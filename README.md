## F.A.Q
Answer a few frequently asked questions;
### üí¨ Can you read my messages?
This project is open source so all the codes are clear. Neither less nor more; you can look what you want. **We absolutely do not have access to your accounts.**

### üîê What about our security?
If you are concerned about security, you can install it on your own computer. If you think someone else has captured your data, simply click on **Whatsapp> Three Dots> Whatsapp Web> Logout** from all sessions button.

### üíµ Is it paid?
**Of course not.** It will never happen. But you can donate to us. You can reach me via [Telegram](https://t.me/fusuf) .

### üåü Is there enough features?
Yes. WhatsAsena comes with more than 170 internal command. Which including unique packages, machine learning AIs, fastly tools etc.. Users can add new features their bots. Check our [telegram group](https://t.me/AsenaSupport) .

### üõ°Ô∏è Cyber Attack Protection?
Only original [WhatsAsena](https://github.com/phaticusthiccy/WhatsAsenaDuplicated) do this. It has own unique protection style inside WhatsAsena's database. It protect your phone from WhatApp attacks. Thats mean all fake creations carries a big risk for users privacy.

### üß† What is Eva Neural AI?
**Eva** is powered with neural networks, artificial brain cells and brain that can remember conversation. **Eva** developed by me for like a virtual assistants. __(Siri, Sam, Tesla etc..)__ 
WhatsAsena has %5 data of **Eva** to interact with users. Our gan datas stored on Brainshop. If users want to access **Eva**, they must start message with `Eva`

### üê∫ What does Asena mean?
[Asena](https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asena), comes from Turkish mythology. According to Turkish mythology, Asena is a she-wolf that plays an important role.

<details>
  <summary><h3>Other Questions ‚ùî</h3></summary>

### Data Traffic
WhatsAsena encrypts all datas while sending messages, receiving messages, updates etc. There is no possible memory leaks.

### Changing Branchs on Local Installation
WhatsAsena uses always **master** branch. If users cloned other branches, they can't able to install it.

### How Interp Command Works? 
**.interp** command useful for interpolating low frame rate videos. This system, which is the first in the world, is also seen in WhatsAsena, the world's first UserBot. Basically it superimposes the previous frame and produces new frames to replace blank datas. By doing a simple calculation, If we use **.interp 60** to a 300 frame 10 second video, the output will be about 4000-6000 frame.

### My Bot is Very Slowly, What should I do?
Firstly, you can check your ethernet connection. Your ping, packet loss and bandwidth. WhatsAsena uses phone's ethernet connection (Wi-Fi, Li-Fi, Mobile). So This is not about the WhatsAsena, it's about the device or the internet used.

### Where Can I Find the Number of Users? 
You can look at the values ‚Äã‚Äãwritten under our logo above. This value shows the current number of users.

### Should I Trust Other Bots Like WhatsAsena?
This choice is yours, There are a lot of fake bots using our codes. Can be dangerous as they are not official. Moreover, since there is no cyber attack protection in fake bots, the device can be easily accessed whenever any vulnerability is found.

### Why Are Updates Coming Late?
Because I'm the only developer. I need to test every step. I need to check each branch and import it into unique npm package. And I have a social life too :)

### When Will Support Be Cut Off?
When the WhatsAsena learns to solve all its problems by itself. My first goal is to provide this stuff.
